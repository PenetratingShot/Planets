# Planets
A clean, minimalistic Planets app designed to teach people about the world around us

**NOTE:** Since this project uses [CocoaPods](cocoapods.org), you'll have to open the `Planets.xcworkspace` fie instead of coosing the project through the Xcode project finder in order to harness the ful potential of the Pods installed.

Happy Coding :D
