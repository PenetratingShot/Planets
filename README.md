# Planets
A clean, minimalistic Planets app designed to teach people about the world around us

**NOTE:** Since this project uses [CocoaPods](cocoapods.org), you'll have to open the `Planets.xcworkspace` fie instead of choosing the project through the Xcode project finder in order to harness the full potential of the Pods installed.
(Though if you get lucky like me, Xcode will _automagically_ regognize the `Planets.xcworkspace` file and set it as default to open the project.

Happy Coding :D
